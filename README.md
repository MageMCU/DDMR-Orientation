# DDMR-Orientation Repository

- Orientation of the Differential-Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR) using a magnetometer. 

- This is the last project of the year 2023 except I will review the repositories for completeness and functionality. The DDMR-Orientation was a planned project since summer of 2022, yet it all started in the year 2018 with the first simulation in 2019... 

- Compass Code Take 3 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNU_OpvKLk" target="_blank">Youtube</a>

- Most of the new repositories at MageMCU were developed to further study the DDMR orientation. It is my hope to finish the remaining articles during the rest of the year and in the year 2024, publish a new simulation version - Compass Code at Youtube.

## Testing Platform

- This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.

- **PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 

- **Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.

## Issues

- None

## In Development

- 20230525 major-update... Bug fixes, overall update on ControlManagerV2.h, src folder: STATES, MASTER and SLAVE... Work in progress...

## NOTICE

- The code uses a magnetometer sensor which is integrated into the code... If by chance you have a different sensor, the sensor code may be exchanged with your code...
