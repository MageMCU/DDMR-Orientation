# DDMR-Orientation Repository

- Orientation of the Differential-Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR) using a magnetometer. 

## Testing Platform

- This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.

- **PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 

- **Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.

## Issues

- None

## In Development

- 20230516

## NOTICE

- The code uses a magnetometer sensor which is integrated into the code... If by chance you have a different sensor, the sensor code may be exchanged with your code... This is the last project of the year 2023 except I will review the repositories for completeness abd functionality. The DDMR-Orientation was a planned project since summer of 2022, it is an accumulation of all the work presented in the repositories at MageMCU.
